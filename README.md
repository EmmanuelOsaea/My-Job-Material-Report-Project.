Sure, here are two sample research writing pieces related to LGBTQ+ community history and issues in the U.S.:

**Sample 1: The Stonewall Riots: A Catalyst for LGBTQ+ Rights**
The Stonewall Riots of 1969 are often cited as a pivotal moment in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States. These riots, which took place at the Stonewall Inn in New York City's Greenwich Village, marked the first significant instance of LGBTQ+ individuals fighting back against systematic police harassment and social discrimination. This event galvanized the LGBTQ+ community, leading to the formation of various advocacy groups, such as the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance. These groups organized subsequent protests and demonstrations, which laid the groundwork for the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.

The impact of the Stonewall Riots cannot be overstated. They transformed the LGBTQ+ community from a marginalized and often invisible group into a visible and vocal segment of society, demanding equal rights and recognition. The riots led to the establishment of annual Pride marches, starting with the first Pride March in New York City in 1970. These marches have since become a global phenomenon, serving both as a celebration of LGBTQ+ identity and a call to action against ongoing discrimination and injustice.

**Sample 2: LGBTQ+ Homelessness: A Crisis of Identity and Survival**
Homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth is a critical issue in the United States, disproportionately affecting this vulnerable population. According to the Williams Institute, LGBTQ+ youth represent 40% of the homeless youth population, despite only making up an estimated 7% of the total youth population. The primary causes of homelessness in this community include family rejection due to sexual orientation or gender identity, abuse, and a lack of supportive services.

Family rejection is a significant factor contributing to LGBTQ+ youth homelessness. Many young people are forced to leave their homes after coming out to their families, leading to a life on the streets or in unstable housing situations. This lack of familial support often results in increased vulnerability to exploitation, mental health issues, substance abuse, and victimization. Furthermore, LGBTQ+ homeless youth face additional barriers when seeking assistance from shelters and services, which may not be equipped to address their specific needs or may even exhibit discriminatory practices.

Addressing LGBTQ+ homelessness requires a multifaceted approach, including increasing awareness, funding supportive services tailored to the LGBTQ+ community, and implementing policies that protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination. Organizations such as the Ali Forney Center in New York City have made significant strides in providing comprehensive support to LGBTQ+ homeless youth, including housing, medical care, and educational services. However, broader systemic change is necessary to ensure that all LGBTQ+ youth have the opportunity to lead safe, healthy, and fulfilling life.
